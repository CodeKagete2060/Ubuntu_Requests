# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Ubuntu-Inspired Image Fetcher

> *"I am because we are"* – The Wisdom of Ubuntu 🌍  

This project is a simple Python script that reflects the spirit of Ubuntu by **connecting to the global web community**, **respectfully fetching shared images**, and **organizing them for later sharing and appreciation**.  

---

## ✨ Features
- Prompts the user for an **image URL**  
- Creates a folder called **`Fetched_Images`** if it doesn’t exist  
- Downloads the image and saves it inside the folder  
- Automatically extracts the **filename from the URL** (or generates one if missing)  
- Handles errors gracefully (e.g., no internet, bad URL, timeouts)  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `requests` → Fetches the image from the internet  
  - `os` → Creates directories and manages file paths  
  - `urllib.parse` → Extracts filenames from URLs  

---

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
